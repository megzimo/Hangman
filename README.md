# Hangman-Final

In this game, the player must type in a letter in order to guess the names of characters in Fox's #1 Hit TV Show that was definitely never cancelled, Futurama.
The player is given 9 guess attempts to spell the character name before the game restarts and marks their previous attempt as a "Loss"
When the player correctly fills in the name of the character before they run out of guess attempts, the game resets and marks their game completion as a "Win".
Letters that are incorrectly guessed are displayed in the "Wrong Letter Bank", and players do not lose a guess if they re-enter a key they've already pressed during that particular game. 

This project utilizes HTML, CSS for organization, display and style, and relies on Javacsript for gameplay.
